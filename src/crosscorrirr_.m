% CROSSCORRIRR_ irregular timeseries cross-correlation
%
%  Syntax:
%
%    [xcf, lags, tau] = crosscorrirr(t1, y1, t2, y2)
%    [xcf, lags, tau] = crosscorrirr(t1, y1, t2, y2, numLags)
%    [xcf, lags, tau] = crosscorrirr(t1, y1, t2, y2, numLags, tau)
%
% Description:
%
%   Compute the sample cross-correlation function (XCF) between irregularly
%   sampled univariate stochastic time series.
%
% Input Arguments:
%
%   t1 - Vector of time points of the first univariate time series.
%
%   y1 - Vector of observations of the first univariate time series
%     corresponding to sample times as given in t1.
%
%   t2 - Vector of time points of the second univariate time series.
%
%   y2 - Vector of observations of the second univariate time series
%     corresponding to sample times as given in t2.
%
% Optional Input Arguments:
%
%   numLags - Positive integer indicating the number of lags of the XCF to
%     compute. If empty or missing, the default is to compute the XCF at
%     lags 0, +/-1, +/-2,...,+/-T, where T is the minimum of 20 or one less
%     than the length of the shortest series.
%
%   tau - Common time resolution of t1 and t2.
%     If omitted the gcd of the mean differences in t1 and mean differences
%     in t2 will be used, and returned as 3 return value.
%
% Output Arguments:
%
%   xcf - Sample cross-correlation function between (t1,y1) and (t2,y2).
%     xcf is a vector of length 2*numLags+1 corresponding to lags
%     0, +/-1, +/-2, ..., +/-numLags. The center element of xcf contains
%     the zeroth-lag cross correlation. xcf will be a column vector.
%
%   lags - Vector of lags.
%
%   tau - Resolution of the lags.
%
%   bounds - Two-element vector indicating the approximate upper and lower
%     confidence bounds, assuming the input series are uncorrelated.
